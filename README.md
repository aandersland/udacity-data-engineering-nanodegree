# Overview

This repo contains the projects for the Data Engineering Nanodegree program from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027).

## Project 1 - Data Modeling with PostgreSql - In progress
In this project I modeled user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. This was accomplished by the following:
* Created a relational database using PostgreSql
* Defined Fact and Dimension tables
* Built an ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. 
* Loaded the database

Technologies used: Python, PostgreSql


## Project 2 - Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra - Not started
In this project I modeled user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. This was accomplished by the following:
* Created a relational database using Apache Cassandra
* Defined Fact and Dimension tables
* Built an ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. 
* Loaded the database

Technologies used: Python, Apache Cassandra

## Project 3 - Cloud Data Warehouses - Not started
In this project I built an ETL pipeline that enables the analytics team at Sparkify to gain insights into song usage by their customers. This was accomplished by the following:
* Setup AWS infrastructure using IaC
* Extract data from S3
* Stage data in Redshift
* Transform data into dimensional tables for analytics

Technologies used: Python, S3, IAM, VPC, EC2, RDS, PostgreSql


## Project 4 - Data Lake with Spark - Not started
In this project I built an ETL pipeline to create a data lake for the Sparkify team. This was accomplished by the following:
* Extract JSON logs on user activity from S3
* Extract JSON metadata on songs from S3 
* Build a Spark process to load data into analytic tables
* Upload the results back into S3
* Execute the Spark process on an AWS cluster

Technologies used: Python, SparkSQL, Spark Dataframes, Spark WebUI, S3, EMR, Athena, Amazon Glue


## Project 5 - Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow - Not started
In this project I further enhanced the data pipelines for the Sparkify team. This was accomplished by the following:
* Creating a new set of data pipelines
* Automating those pipelines by configuring and scheduling them in Airflow
* Monitor and debug the Airflow pipelines

Technologies used: Python, Apache Aiflow


## Capstone Project - Not started
Combine what you've learned throughout the program to build your own data engineering portfolio project.

Technologies used: Python
